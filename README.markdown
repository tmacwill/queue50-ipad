CS50 Help iPad
==============

iPad UI for CS50 Help (formerly known as office hours). Staff can view pending questions, staff on duty, and dispatch
questions to staff members. On the left are pending questions, displayed in the order they were asked. To dispatch
questions, select them from the left panel, then tap a staff member on the right. Students will be informed via the CS50
web UI that they have been dispatched.
